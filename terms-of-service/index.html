        <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
        <p>TruScope is a tool that uses a web scraper and artificial intelligence to analyze the content of web pages for potential bias. The Service is provided for informational purposes only and is not intended to be a definitive judgment on the content's objectivity. The AI's analysis represents a technological interpretation and should be used to supplement, not replace, critical thinking.</p>

        <h2>3. User Conduct and Restrictions</h2>
        <p>You agree not to use the Service for any unlawful purpose or in any way that could harm, disable, or impair the Service. Prohibited actions include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Attempting to reverse-engineer, decompile, or discover the source code of the Service or its underlying AI models.</li>
            <li>Using the Service to analyze content that you do not have the legal right to access.</li>
            <li>Automating access to the Service in a way that places an unreasonable load on our servers.</li>
            <li>Using the Service to harass, defame, or infringe on the rights of others.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Intellectual Property</h2>

        <h2>5. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
        <p>The Service is provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis. We make no warranty that the Service will meet your requirements, be accurate, reliable, or uninterrupted. The bias analysis provided is generated by an AI and may contain errors or inaccuracies. You use the Service at your own risk.</p>

        <h2>6. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>In no event shall TruScope be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages arising out of or in connection with your use of the Service, whether or not we have been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>

        <h2>7. Termination</h2>
        <p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to the Service at any time, without notice, for any reason, including for a breach of these Terms. You can terminate this agreement at any time by uninstalling the extension.</p>
        
        <h2>8. Changes to These Terms</h2>
        <p>We may modify these Terms from time to time. We will provide notice of significant changes by updating the "Last Updated" date. Your continued use of the Service after any modification constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms.</p>
